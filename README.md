# FS4J
An abstract file system for Java. The purpose of this project is to increase file I/O safety by isolating what directories users can read from and write to. 

### Todo list:
- [x] Project outline
- [ ] Add several utility methods to the `FSFile` class
- [ ] Expand the file system to be able to handle more archive types (currently only `.zip`).
